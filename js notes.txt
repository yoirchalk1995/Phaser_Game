the code will always return the first value to trigger the logic
truthy and falsy values will be returned and not be parsed to Boolean
therefor

userColorChoice  = 'red'
standardColor = 'green'

userColorChoice || standardColor
returns
red

userColorChoice = ''
userColorChoice || standardColor
returns
green

list = [1,2,3]

list&&<h1>List isn't empty</h1>
returns
<h1>List isn't empty</h1>
b/c that is the value that caused the logic to return

Bitwise operations

& - single ampre - returns a 1 if both bits are one
| - single bar - returns 1 if either bit is one
